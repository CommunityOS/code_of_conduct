# Privacy Policy

CommunityOS takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, CommunityOS provides this privacy policy notice explaining how your personal information is collected and used.

- We respect your privacy, always have, and always will.
- We never disclose individual information under any context; we always provide aggregate information in our analyses. This makes it impossible to know your individual opinion or view.
- We assure you that we will never sell your data: we never have, and we never will.
- We do not engage in SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have opted to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from this type of correspondence.

## What data we collect and why
We collect data that allows us to perform our analysis to detect behavior patterns to understand the culture of organizations and remote work.

In practice, the data we collect (and explicitly some we do not collect) include:

**Identity and access**
To interact with our products and participate in our studies, we usually ask for your name and email address. This allows us to identify you so you can access your information and our products. It also enables us to send you payment documents, updates, or other essential information.

Email correspondence: Here we clarify immediately: We do not engage in SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have opted to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from this type of correspondence.

**Billing information**
When you pay for one of our products, we will ask for billing information. This allows us to generate and send you an invoice. Currently, we do not use an internal payment system for credit or debit cards; instead, we use third-party services like Stripe, Mercadopago, and Webpay.

**Geolocation**
We record all your access to our products through your IP address to verify unauthorized access (login). We keep these access records as long as your account is active.

We record the IP address you use to create an account in our products. We keep this data forever because we use it to mitigate spam registrations.

Web analytics — described later under Web Interaction — is also associated with the IP address to help us troubleshoot and improve our strategy.

**Web Interaction**
When your browser accesses our marketing pages, products, or applications, it automatically shares certain information, such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track this information, along with the page you visit, the page load time, and which web service referred you to us for statistical purposes such as conversion rate, and to test new designs. This analytics is linked to your IP address and user data if applicable and you are registered for our services.

We use third-party applications for web analytics, specifically Google Analytics. In the future, we want to remove this service to have a better analytics system since Google uses this information for its own products.

**Anti-bot**
We use CAPTCHA in our applications to mitigate brute force access attempts and SPAM.

**Cookies and Do Not Track**
We use “persistent first-party cookies” to save preferences and make it easier for you to access our applications. A “cookie” is text stored by your browser to help remember your login information, preferences, and more. You can adjust how long cookies are stored in your browser. To learn about cookies, including how to see which cookies are being used, how they are managed, and how to delete them, please visit allaboutcookies.org.

**Correspondence and voluntary data**
When you write to us with a question and request help, we keep that conversation, including your email address, so we have a history of past conversations for future reference if necessary.

We also store any information you provide voluntarily, such as surveys and forms. Sometimes we interview our clients and may ask permission to record the conversation for future reference. We only do this with your express consent.

**Data provided in the context of consulting**
You may participate as an employee of one of our clients and be invited to participate in a study with us. If this is the case, we always promote voluntary participation and inform you of the minimum response requirements to achieve adequate reliability in sample sizes.

Every time you participate in one of our studies, your responses will always be private, and we will never share specific data, responses, or results related to you as an individual with any third party (including your employer). We respect your privacy, always have, and always will.

Our analyses, conclusions, and results regarding studies on the culture of an organization have always been and will always be at an aggregate level. In these studies, we aim to understand collective behavior.

**Again**
- We respect your privacy, always have, and always will.
- We never disclose individual information under any context; we always provide aggregate information in our analyses. This makes it impossible to know your individual opinion or view.
- We assure you that we will never sell your data: we never have, and we never will.
- We do not engage in SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have opted to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from this type of correspondence.

## When we access your information and when we share it
Our default practice is not to access your information. The only times we access your information are to:

Provide the product or service you requested. We use third-party services to use our applications, and these data are linked to these third-party services. This means we use technological services to access and query your data (of course, they are not printed on paper and stored in file cabinets). These processes do not include any human accessing your data unless an error occurs in our automated processes and we need to manually fix something. In the rare cases when this happens, we seek the root problem to prevent it from happening again.

**Solve a problem**
To help resolve issues related to our products or services. If at any point we need to access your user account data due to a support need.

**Misuse of our products or services**
To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding misuse of our products or services. We access your data when investigating potential abuse; this is a last resort measure.

We are obligated to protect the privacy and security of our clients and those who report problems. We do our best to balance both responsibilities. If we discover that you are using our products or services abusively or have violated our code of conduct, we will report the incidents to the relevant authorities if appropriate.

## Your rights
We recognize and respect your rights.

**Right to know.** You have the right to know what information is collected, used, shared, or sold. In this policy, we outline the data we collect and how it is used (or not).

**Right to access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we collect about you, and your right to obtain information about how it is shared, stored, secured, and processed.

**Right to correct.** You have the right to correct your personal information.

**Right to delete / “to be forgotten.”** It is your right to request this, that your personal information be deleted from our possession and, by extension, from all our service providers. Fulfilling some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our products and services because our applications may cease to work for you. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in the closure of your account.

**Right to complain.** You have the right to file a complaint about the handling of your personal information with the relevant supervisory authority.

**Right to restrict the processing of your information.** You have the right to request the restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including the option not to sell personal information. (Again: we have never sold nor will we ever sell your data)

**Right to object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.

**Right to portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.

**Right not to be subject to automated decision-making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that may have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely on the basis of automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for the fulfillment of any contract between you and us, is permitted by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.

**Right to non-discrimination.** You have the right not to be discriminated against. We do not charge you a different amount for using our products, offer you different discounts, or provide you with a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, exercising certain rights (such as the right to "be forgotten") may prevent you from using our Services.

## How we secure your data
All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our server to your browser. The backup database is also encrypted.

**Deleting data**
In many of our applications, you will have the option to delete your data. The data you choose to delete will be discarded, and will not be accessible to you or us. In general, your data will be inaccessible from the moment you decide to delete it. We are committed to deleting your data from our servers within 30 days of your request.

**Location of data**
Our products and web applications operate in Chile. However, the data storage is digital and based on servers in the United States through Cloudflare, Digital Ocean, and Amazon Web Services.

## Changes and questions
We may update this policy as necessary to comply with important regulations and to reflect any new practices regarding protecting your privacy. Changes to the policy will be updated in this same place, and in the future, you will be able to see these changes on GitHub.
